Please don't edit man pages directly in this folder. Man pages are created from
MariaDB Connector/C wiki.

To update manpages, please follow the following steps:

1) Add, change or remove content directly in MariaDB Connector/C Wiki
2) Clone the repository to your local drive
3) Run the python script scripts/create_man from the root directory of
   your connector/c tree with the following parameters:

   --docs = specifies the destination of your local Connector/C wiki repository
   --funcs = specifies a file which contains all exported functions. This file will 
             be build automatically when running Connector/C build. The filename is
             "manpages.list" and it will be stored in root of your build directory
   --version = actual version of Connector/C.


   Example: python3 scripts/create_man.py --docs=/home/georg/cc_docs --version=3.2.1 \
                                          --funcs=./bld/manpages.lst
